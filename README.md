## Build Documentation

The static documentation site is build using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
See the [official installation instructions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/#installation)
for installing the `mkdocs` tool.

Then you can just run the following to build and serve the documentation locally and open your browser at <http://localhost:8000/>.

```sh
mkdocs serve
```
